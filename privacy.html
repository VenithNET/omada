<h2> Privacy </h2>

<h3> Logging </h3>
<p> At Omada, we attempt to take the "mullvad approach" of taking as little data as possible, and keeping even less logged. </p>
<p> Yet, we have to log some. Here is a list. <br><br>
     Nginx - Access logs are disabled. Unless you cause any form of an error, there are no logs. <br><br>
     Fedi, Invidious, Matrix - We use nginx to proxy these, and X-Forwarded along with X-Real-IP headers are disabled. Nginx does not log, nor do these services themselves. <br><br>
     DNS - We have made the hard decision to keep absolutely no logs. This does not mean your ISP or any government is not watching any part of the internet though, and do not assume your plaintext queries are private. We are currently attempting to find a way to setup DoH. <br><br>
     Mumble - We keep absolutely no mumble logs. </p>
<h3> Feds </h3>
<p> We are not going to lose our infrastructure for you. We are not going to go to jail for you. We are not going to ruin the privacy of every other user for you. <br>
If the feds come, we are going to give over all info we have to. </p>

<h3> Configs </h3>
